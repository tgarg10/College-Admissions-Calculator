[2:42 PM 1/1/2022] Hellow Admission office. I hope you're doing good. I'm kind of in a rush 
		   so let's catch up some time soon shall we? 
		   Click here if you'd like to skip to the end.

[2:03 PM 1/1/2022]: I have an idea. I only have 10 hours for it though. I wish I was joking. Online statistics aren't good enough. I need my own AI that takes parameters (SATs, Ethinicity, etc.)
and returns the acceptance rate.

Harvard Alumini is ironically for Alumini only. People unfortunately don't put their SAT scores on LinkedIn so that's out of the options. Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok - bad idea for more
than a million reasons.

Found it. Admitsee has all the data I will need: SAT scores, ACT, Ethnicity, Sports. 

I will have to either iterate through every web page and write the information down on an Excel sheet or download 455 student profiles. I think I know the obvious one.

[2:30 PM 1/1/2022] I'm curious

[2:30 PM 1/1/2022] Did you know that Track & Field is the most popular sport at Harvard. I thought it was gonna be Rowing (Crew) honestly. 

{'Badminton': 1, 'Tennis': 65, 'Track &amp; Field': 76, 'Basketball': 30, 'Squash': 3, 'Wrestling': 6, 'Cross Country': 52, 'Rugby': 4, 'Weight Lifting': 1, 'Martial Arts': 7, 
'Sailing': 2, 'Baseball': 16, 'Football': 27, 'Bowling': 2, 'Hockey': 7, 'Rowing (Crew)': 15, 'Lacrosse': 22, 'Gymnastics': 2, 'Swimming/Diving': 47, 'Softball': 9, 'Field Hockey': 12,
 'Skiing': 13, 'Volleyball': 23, 'Mountain Biking/Cycling': 2, 'Soccer': 57, 'Table Tennis (Ping Pong)': 1, 'Golf': 12, 'Dance': 7, 'Fencing': 13, 'Water Polo': 5, 'Equestrian': 3, 
'Cheer/Spirit Squad': 4}

[2:32 PM 1/1/2022] Anyways back to work.

[5:06 PM 1/1/2022] Polished the data more. Started work on the website as well.

[5:09 PM 1/1/2022] Most of the data I have is for the Class of 2018-19. 

[5:12 PM 1/1/2022] I can't find any test data for people who get denied. We'll have to use just
		   acceptence statistics for this machine learning.

[5:15 PM 1/1/2022] The average SAT score is 1536. I wonder if the diversity in the time period matters.
			Oh also the average GPA score is 4.6 unweighted on a scale of 5. 
			Got that one covered atleast. The average ACT score is 34. 

[5:17 PM 1/1/2022] 53.4% are male and 44.3% females. Only 1.3% others. These statistics mean nothing 
			but they're interesting I guess.

[9:37 PM 1/1/2022] I got just done with the website. I need to get it live now.
